<h1>How to Pay Off Home Loan Early Calculator: How to repay home loan quickly?</h1>
<p>Nowadays everyone dreams of buying their own home, but fulfilling this dream seems a bit difficult because home loan is a long-term commitment. Sometimes we want to repay our home loan quickly so that we can pay less money in interest and become debt-free quickly. For this, &ldquo;home loan early payoff calculator&rdquo; is a great tool that helps you understand how and how quickly you can repay your loan.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>If you also want to pay off your home loan quickly, then today we will give you some tips and tell you how a home loan early payoff calculator works. In this article, we will discuss everything that will help you pay off your home loan quickly.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h2>What is Home Loan Early Pay Off Calculator?</h2>
<p>Home loan early payoff calculator is an online tool that helps you estimate how quickly you will be able to pay off your loan if you increase your loan EMI or additional payments. This tool gives you a clear picture of the remaining tenure of the loan, interest savings, and monthly budget.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h2>How to Pay Off Home Loan Early? (Tips to Pay Off Home Loan Early)</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>1. Use the prepayment option</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Prepayment means that you repay some extra money apart from the regular EMIs of your loan. Many banks and financial institutions offer the option of prepayment in which you do not have to pay any extra charge. Putting in a little extra money every year can give you a lot of interest savings and can also reduce the loan tenure.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>2. Increase the EMI</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If your salary or income increases, then you can also increase your EMI. This will help you repay the loan quickly. Increasing the EMI means that you are paying off the principal amount quickly, which reduces the interest load.</p>
<p><br></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>3. Make Lumpsum Payment</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Putting the money earned from any bonus or investment directly into your loan can be a smart decision. If you get any lumpsum amount like bonus, tax refund or inheritance, then putting it in the principal amount of your home loan can help pay off the loan quickly.</p>
<p><br></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>4. Understand Loan Restructuring</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Many banks give you the option of loan restructuring. In this, you can change the interest rate or tenure of your loan. If you feel that the interest rate is too high, you can take a loan at a lower interest rate by refinancing from another bank, which will help you repay the loan quickly.</p>
<p><br></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>5. Opt for Half-Yearly EMI Plan</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>For many people, it is a good option to divide their EMI into half-yearly payments. This way you can get 13 EMIs instead of 12 in a year. With this one extra EMI, you can repay the loan very quickly.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h2>How to use Home Loan Early Payoff Calculator?</h2>
<p>If you want to understand how a home loan calculator works, here is a basic explanation:</p>
<p><br></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>1. Loan Amount:</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>First of all, you have to enter your total loan amount in the calculator. This will be the same amount that you have taken as a loan from the bank.</p>
<p><br></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>2. Interest Rate:</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You have to enter the applicable interest rate on your loan. Every bank has a different interest rate, so it is also important to keep this in mind.</p>
<p><br></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>3. Loan Tenure:</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Loan tenure means for how long you have taken the loan. This time period can be 10 years, 20 years or 30 years.</p>
<p><br></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>4. Prepayment Amount:</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This is the amount you want to pay extra so that you can repay your loan quickly. By entering this amount in the calculator, you can see how quickly you will be able to repay your loan.</p>
<p><br></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>5. New EMI:</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If you are increasing your EMI, you can also enter your new EMI. The calculator will show you how much difference will be there in your tenure and interest payments.</p>
<p><br></p>
